                        	I say this all the time, but I think the most difficult problems related to software, is figuring out how to effectively allow many developers to work on one project and deliver more value, without slowing down the project due to integration or training problems. And while this can be an issue anywhere, I think for small teams, there's a lot more solutions available. 
        <br>
                        </p>
        <p>
        Careful project management and well planned oversight are the solution to most of these issues, for teams big and small, but as your codebase and developer count continues to grow, it evolves into something that's infinitely harder to maintain and control, even with the most effective management and oversight. Retaining the knowledge from the problems you've already solved ends up being a MUCH larger issue than it should be. We have source control, bug tracking systems, wiki pages to attempt to solve the issue of not having to re-invent wheels for our problems, but it seems like no matter how much knowledge is retained, some information still manages to slip through the cracks.
        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
	We always tend to log that a particular issue or bug has been resolved, but rarely do we think to keep that specific method of resolution in mind. The problem is remembered but the fix is forgotten. Having to solve the same issue twice should be easily avoidable given the robust suite of tools that we have available to us as developers. Stack Overflow is a good introduction to solving this problem, specific questions are presented for the purpose of solving specific problems, and the solutions are in an easily searchable format for all of us to gain from. This kind of solution could be put to use for any codebase, not just a language in general. Having a consolidated and simple place to put the resolutions to problems you encounter and solve as a developer (especially environmental issues) could save plenty of time for other devs.
                            </p>

	As developers, I think we need to take a more agressive approach to solving this. Eliminating lost knowledge in our work process could make a world of difference in the time that it takes from concept to working solution on any given product. Of course, this isn't news to most of us. We're more often asking the important question of how? There's already a few useful tools in existence in the world of devlopment that scratch the surface of this issues, but having one single repository of information on your codebase requires an organization structure that few software packages are able to provide at this point in time. Careful documentation is a start, but I think the future of solving this problem lies in the devlopement of another kind of solution for developers that we haven't quite seen yet.
