<p>  
I should probably make this abundantly clear first, I am, in no way claiming that you should not teach your kids how to program. I think in some cases it is the best thing you can do; showing your kid how they can express creativity through building with code. Being taught to code as a child reason why I'm a programmer and love programming so much (thanks mom, code also ruined my life though, so there's that), but what I DO think is really important is NOT underestimating your childs ability to learn.
</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I remember as a 11 or 12 year old, my mother gifting me as a present, a large scary looking collection of Visual Basic 6 books, when I told her I wanted to learn "how to make video games". Even as an adult, I'll admit, those things are pretty frightening looking (GUYS AT MSDN, CAN YOU PLEAASE UPDATE YOUR UX FROM WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE IN 2001? IT WOULD HAVE MADE MY CHILDHOOD LESS SCARY THANKS), but as a kid, when you're able to focus on, and visualize the thing that you want to make, you can pull out the pieces of information that you need, in order to create whatever is in your mind. Your brain is a lot more malleable then, in contrast to how your brain works when you get older, so I think you can actually learn a lot more faster, (your brain still operates under the premise of 'oh, that's just how that works?'). 
                            </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
In the recent years, there's been a huge push to teach kids to code. Movements like Hour of Code, Projects like Tynker, and then there's the specifially "built for education" programming tools like Scratch and Grace.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        I kind of think these sorts of things, don't excatly account for the intelligence of kids. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                           Scratch seeks to introduce kids to programming from a user friendly drag and drop interface that essentially lets them drop code structure elements into a visual "program", and while its completely visual and mightbe  much easier to parse for kids, I think it actually stops short of teaching them a real skill, and it seems like its more of a teaching tool for abstract and conceptually thinking more than anything else. It might not be dumbing down the problem (you could argue that the skills carry over, like with any real programming language), except that as a kid, I don't think that's what you'll remember.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I had a recent talk with a 10 year old relative of mine, about his Lego Robotics NXT class, where he informed me that they were learning a language called ROBOT C, as a kind of introduction to programming and logic concepts. Upon looking at the syntax however, it's just REAL C. He was able to identify the parts of a standard C program in the same way that he might as a part of the building blocks of learning full fledged software development
</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        I think the teaching tool here is actually the goal they want to accomplish rather than the way the information is presented. Moving a real physical robot around and having it perform tasks is the part that simplifies the concepts. 
Presenting something visual (tat's whats of interest to the kids) moves the problem domain into something they care about an understand, but the skill that they walk away with, is real and practical.

                        </p>
