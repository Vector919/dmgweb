                       It's pretty afwul when you have to write code that looks like this 
</p>
                        <p>
<pre class = "brocode">
	object.thing = data['thing']
	object.thing2 = data['thing2']
	object.thing3 = data['thing3']
</pre>
</p>
<p>Or even WORSE sometimes, you'll have to write code that looks like this</p>
<p>
<pre class = "brocode">
data1['thing'] = data2['Thing']
data1['thing2'] = data2['Thing2']
data1['thing3'] = data2['Thing3']
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This is the single most frustrating type code you'll ever be forced into writing as a programmer. 
You arent solving an interesting problem by transforming/mapping data, 
but its something that we ALL end up doing at one point or another, because of the way that large applications are designed.
Having mutiple data formats that need to communicate with one another is typical when interfacing with external API's or legacy systems,
and that will end up forcing you to write uninteresting code in your application.
</p>
                <p>
Of course,  you can optimize the tranformations with some tricks depending on the language yo
u're using, and the kind of work that needs to be done 
(In Python you can fix that first one KIND OF with something stupid like)
<br>
                </p>
                <pre class = "brocode">
for field in object.__dict__:
	setattrr(object, field, data[field])
</pre>
                <br>
                <p>
but still, there are those situations where you can't get around doing the data cowboy garbage. 
Instead of working on the larger problems that you might have with your application, you'll have to sit down and focus on making sure that the different data formats 
you use all have appropriate conversion methods, which seems wasteful when a better principal of design would be to standardize your formats of information.
</p>
                <p>
In situations where you have control over the data your application uses. (this goes without saying but) THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT IT. Plan out a common format that you can universally update,
think about integrations and make it your primary goal to avoid complicated code that objectivises a data format or transforms  the information you need to something else. 
Universal data formats within a single type should be a paramount goal of your application. It's easy to just say, ahhh what the hell we can add these fields now that 
aren't in our legacy data" but that's how you get fragmented garbage, that won't make sense to you months down the line. 
</p>
                <br>
                <p>
If you still find yourself HAVING to do it,
As much as you can, keep this kind of transformation and code out of the normal flow of your application (in a module designated for this kind of work), so that it's easier 
to import and re-use as many times as necessary (had to learn this the hard way when i started learning Django)
</p>
                <p>
if you DONT have control, you can at least do a decent amount of work to make sure that you don't do the same work twice. Write a single helper method for data transformation that handles ALL of the cases (whether the data is there or not). In environments where you have to conform to a code standard, your fellow developers will surely thank you for providing a common idiomatic way of doing things. and KEEP TRACK OF CHANGES (this is usually to the core of the problem).
