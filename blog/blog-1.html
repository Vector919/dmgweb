                        <strong>What is the worst programming language ever created?</strong>
                            <br><br>
                        <p>
I've approached some of the most socially inept and conversation-challenged programmers to ever walk the face of this earth with this question as my opening line. Which has resulted in conversations(borderline fist-fights), that I was not mentally (or physically) prepared to have.
</p>
                        <p>
The common answers are PHP, because of its naming conventions, or Perl because of how it's a massive mess on paper, or Lotus-script because of every single damn aspect of it. 
                        </p>
<b>Less common answers trigger the true horror. </b>

BancStar, a language for banking systems, is a demonically temperamental monstrosity of a language with over 3000 predefined variables. Additionally its subroutines can be corrupted by a click of anyone of a client's function keys.

LabTalk, the maximum length of a string variable is one character.
No, you didn't misread that. One character. Are you counting your ASCII keys? Don't bother. The creators didn't think you needed that many.
                            </p>
 <br>
An excerpt from the programming manual:
 <br>
                        <br>
                    <blockquote>
LabTalk uses the % notation to define a string variable. A legal string variable name must be a % character followed by a single alphabetic character (a letter from A to Z). String variable names are not case sensitive. Of all the 26 string variables that exist, Origin itself uses 14.
 </blockquote>
                        <br>
                        <b>You couldn't code pong</b>
 <br>
                        <p>
Okay so yes. PHP is all over the place when it comes to naming. and Perl doesn't make for the prettiest code. And Labtalk sounds like a programming language used by the NSA...
 <br>
...as a form of torture once water-boarding became passe. 
 <br>
<br>
I freely grant my foes all of this. So how, or rather why, does the brawl begin? It's because I don't have anything against the unwanted stepchildren of programming.
 
It's because of my disgust towards the poster child of the inter-webs.
 
It's because I REALLY hate JavaScript. 
 
Is it as bad as LabTalk? Probably not. But I don't have to use LabTalk do I? I have it on good authority that I will never have to make use of that ridiculous excuse of a language. 
 
JavaScript though...
 
I will never understand how this piece of trash became one of the most widely known and beloved scripting languages. 
 
Sure, it's easy. Yes, the syntax is clear and concise. Fine, there are a ton of awesome libraries and frameworks supporting it...
 
Okay. Granted, JavaScript has some pretty kick-butt features. But I will never ever have warm cuddly feelings toward it. NEVER. 
 </p>
                        <br>
                        
<strong><i>"Why?"</i> you may wonder.</strong>
 <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>
I'll tell you.
 
First off. Have you ever worked with jQuery? Yes? Then you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
 
Why isn't that a language?
 
Why do we even still have JavaScript? We see how grossly inefficient its syntax is. I don't care how readable it happens to be. The less character's I have to type the more I get done.
 
My second reason is a bit weightier:
 
I'm a pretty decent programmer. 
 
I think things through the way a programmer should. I write out detailed workflows and I make sure my pseudo-code is in order.
 
When I sit down at my computer with a bottle of cherry Coca-cola zero and variously flavored Slimjims I'm ready to knock out an application, or a website, or a program, and I'm determined that it should only take a few hours. 
 
I turn on some EDM or classical music, depending on my mood and I get to work. I'm really on a roll; things are shaping up nicely. I'm already patting myself on the back for being such a fast and efficient programmer. Then it happens. IT ALWAYS HAPPENS. 
  <br><br>
Me: "Hey JavaScript. I just want to spread a canvas over the entire documentBodyHeight. You got something built in for that?"
  <br><br>
JavaScript: "Well...no. No I don't; canvas can't be set to 100%"
  <br><br>
Me: "Oh... okay. That's really too bad. Well can I get the documentBodyHeight in pixels?"
  <br><br>
JavaScript: "Well...yes. But it's a bit of a secret. I won't just tell you. You'll have to figure something out."
  <br><br>
Me: (an hour later) "Okay so I inserted a div and set its z-index super high and set its height to 100% now can I get the height of the div and thus the height of the document using bodyScrollHeight?"
 
JavaScript: "Sure thing. In Chrome. If you're looking for something that works on most all Browsers then I suggest using...well no I guess you're stuck with me."
 
Me: (four hours later) "So I took the measurement of innerWindow height and used the ternary operator to combine it with window offset height, did the same with width and should now have the dimensions of the page. How's that?"
  <br><br>
JavaScript: "Wow. First time I've seen code that only works in IE 8."
  <br><br>
It is at this point in the conversation that I probably fall into a Slimjim and diet coke induced coma.
  <br><br>
In case you've completely missed the purpose behind my crazed discourse with the anthropomorphized JavaScript language; I'll spell it out.
  <br><br>
In spite of the humongous amount of documentation, the tremendous support of stellar frameworks, and a massive demand for the language, JavaScript still lacks the ability to provide coherent and reasonable means to complete simple tasks. 
  <br><br>
I don't want to waste hours figuring out simple procedures that THE LANGUAGE WAS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO COMPLETE. 
  <br><br>
You can create a canvas element in html. JavaScript is supposed to facilitate my interaction with that object. Sure it does its job, 90% of the time. But the other 10% it requires the worst kind of problem solving, trial and error. 
  <br><br>
If JavaScript were a cheese then it'd be Swiss. If it were a pan it'd be a colander.
How can a language be designed so specifically for one thing, yet still leave such irritating, glaring holes?  
 <br><br>
AND WHY DOES EVERYONE ACT AS IF THEY DON'T EXIST?!? As if JavaScript is some sort of promised land of front end programming.  Trust me, until we can adequately manipulate every aspect of basic DOM elements we remain wandering in the wilderness. JavaScript is, at its best, the water that sustains us, barely.
